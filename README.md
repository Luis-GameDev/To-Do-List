# To-Do-List
This is my first desktop application made without an engine, while developing this useful To Do List, im trying to learn more about working with "Windows Forms App" and local database usage. 

# How to Use
In order to try out my application, you will need to find the "net8.0-windows" folder, path: "ToDoList\ToDoList\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows".
Next, you just need to download this folder and execute the application.
